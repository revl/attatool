# autoforge

This project has two goals:

- Generate all required files to build C/C++ projects (libraries and
  applications) from sources using GNU Autotools (Autoconf, Automake,
  Libtool).
- Mainain dependencies between the projects and provide a meta-Makefile
  to build those projects in the correct order.
